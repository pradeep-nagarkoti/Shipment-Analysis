# Shipment Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing shipment data to extract business insights, improve delivery performance, and build machine learning models to predict and optimize outcomes. The dataset includes information about shipment companies, shipment modes, delivery times, costs, profits, and customer feedback.

## Project Objective

To perform end-to-end data analysis on shipment data using real-world business problems and deliver insights under:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Feature Engineering**
- **Business & Descriptive Analytics**
- **Diagnostic Analytics**
- **Predictive Analytics**
- **Prescriptive Analytics**

---

## Key Tasks Covered

###  Part 1: EDA & Feature Engineering
- Data cleaning, type conversion, and missing value handling
- New feature creation: `Cost per km`, `Is Delayed`, etc.
- Outlier detection and treatment using IQR and Z-score
- Categorical encoding and feature scaling

### Business Analysis
- Cost efficiency comparison between companies
- Most delayed modes and costly regions
- Product categories with higher return/delay rates

---

### Part 2: Advanced Analytics

#### Descriptive Analytics (What happened?)
- Average shipment cost by company & mode
- Most common shipment routes
- Monthly return/delay trends
- Delay distribution across companies

#### Diagnostic Analytics (Why did it happen?)
- Reasons behind delays and high shipment costs
- Profit differences between companies
- Fragile & high-value shipment issues

#### Predictive Analytics (What will happen?)
- Will a shipment be delayed?
- What is the expected profit for a shipment?
- Will a COD shipment be returned?
- Predicting customer ratings based on delivery

#### Prescriptive Analytics (What should we do?)
- Optimal shipping mode to minimize cost & delay
- City or company-based routing improvements
- Strategies for reducing returns on COD shipments
